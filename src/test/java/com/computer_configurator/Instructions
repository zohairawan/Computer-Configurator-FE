Check if Liquid Cooler fits in case
------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:
(ONLY SELECT LIQUID COOLER OPTIONS???)
Get other radiator sizes

--- 120mm radiator ---
--- 240mm radiator ---
Fractal Focus G
Fractal North

--- 280mm radiator ---

--- 360mm radiator ---
NZXT H9 Flow
Corsair 5000D Air

--- 420mm radiator ---

PROGRAM:
If case supports max 240mm radiator,
then, check CPU Cooler component to see if it contains any options other than 240mm
if it does, return me a list of the ones that are not 240mm

Repeat the same format for 280mm and 360mm

Get case
    If no case is selected then select the first available case
Check against list (above)
Keep track of which radiator size (list)
Go to CPU Cooler dropdown and get all options
    Make sure list contains only the same radiator of previously kept track one
    If it contains other radiator sizes then make csv file with incorrect radiator size

BETTER-CODER - 240MM
BEST-VIDS - 280MM
BETTER-VIDS - 240MM and 280MM

Cases that support max 4 fans IF using Liquid Cooler:
    Fractal Focus G Case
    Fractal North Case
Cases that support max 7 fans IF using Liquid Cooler:
    Corsair 5000D Case
    NZXT H9 Flow Case
-------- COOLING FAN SCENARIOS --------

PROGRAM:
If CPU Cooler contains the words "liquid cooling"
then, grab the selected option for the "Case" component
then, check against the NOTES list to see how many max fans go with that case IF using Liquid Cooler
then check "Chassis Fans" component to see if the correct number of max fans is there

If CPU Cooler contains the words "cooling fan"
then, grab the selected option for the "Case" component
